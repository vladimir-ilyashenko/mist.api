## This are mist.io dependencies with loose version restrictions.
## Keeping this file helps discover what the actual dependencies are and
## assists in the process of upgrading them. Occasionally we build using this
## requirements file, test everything exhaustively, and then store the output
## of `pip freeze` to requirements-frozen.txt. Using frozen/pinned requirements
## ensures that the build won't break because of a new release of some
## dependency.
